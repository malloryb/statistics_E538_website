## Course Description
Data analysis and statistics for environmental research and policy-making. This course emphasizes logic and illogic hypothesis testing, with a focus on statistical power. Topics include sampling, experimental design, analysis of variance, and regression. You will gain hands-on experience with tools like R and RStudio and develop a data-informed approach to contribute effectively to environmental research and policy.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of E538, students should be able to:

- **Understand and apply core statistical concepts and techniques** within the context of environmental science.
- **Utilize statistical software tools**, such as R and RStudio, for data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modeling.
- **Interpret outcomes and make informed decisions grounded in statistical evidence** within the field of environmental science.
- **Critically evaluate statistical studies** in environmental science, identify potential biases, and understand associated limitations.
- **Communicate statistical findings effectively** and apply statistical methods to real-world environmental data sets.
- **Conduct ethically responsible and statistically sound research** in the field of environmental science.


## Text
The main text for this course is an online GitBook written by the instructor, accessible online. Additional readings, if any, will be posted on Canvas.

## Prerequisites
This course assumes you have taken at least one college-level math course prior to this; however, it is designed to be accessible to students with math anxiety and aims to be as clear as possible. No knowledge of R is required or expected; resources to improve coding in R will be provided on Canvas under the supplemental materials module and are strongly encouraged.

## Course Requirements

### Assignment Types
- **Recitation Assignments (Weekly Labs):** Weekly hands-on labs using R and RStudio to analyze environmental datasets. These contribute 25% of your final grade. Labs must be completed individually by Sunday (at 11:59 pm) of the same week.
- **Data Analysis Report (Project):** Select a data set for analysis and write a 5-7 page report, comprehensible to someone with minimal statistical background. Peer-reviewed by classmates, this project aims to promote critical thinking and collaboration and accounts for 15% of your final grade.
- **Quizzes:** Low-stakes quizzes assess your understanding of recent content and assigned readings. Comprising 10% of your final grade, their format may vary. Four quiz drops are allowed, effectively allowing two weeks of absence without penalty.
- **Midterm Exam:** In-class exam covering the first half of the semester, constituting 25% of your final grade.
- **Final Exam:** Comprehensive in-class exam assessing knowledge of the entire course content, comprising 25% of your final grade.

### Grading Breakdown
- **Recitation Assignments (Weekly Labs):** 25%
- **Group Data Analysis Report:** 15%
- **Quizzes:** 10%
- **Midterm Exam:** 25%
- **Final Exam:** 25%
- **Total:** 100%

### Grading Scale
| Grade | Range       | Grade | Range       |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| A     | 100% to 93% | C     | < 77% to 73% |
| A-    | < 93% to 90%| C-    | < 73% to 70% |
| B+    | < 90% to 87%| D     | < 70% to 67% |
| B     | < 87% to 83%| D+    | < 67% to 63% |
| B-    | < 83% to 80%| D-    | < 63% to 60% |
| C+    | < 80% to 77%| F     | < 60% to 0%  |

# Course Policies and Expectations

## Attendance
- **Consistent Attendance:** Regular attendance is crucial as topics build upon previous lessons. Although not explicitly taken, missing classes may lead to gaps in understanding.
- **Active Participation:** Engage with the material, ask questions, participate in discussions, and work collaboratively. It enriches your learning experience and fosters a supportive learning community.
- **Responsibility for Missed Content:** Review content from missed classes and consult classmates to catch up. Avoid sending emails inquiring about missed content.

## Assignment Policies
- **Makeup Exams:** Make-up exams must be requested a week prior to the exam date for unavoidable conflicts or genuine illness. In cases of illness, inform the instructor and TAs beforehand.
- **Late Assignments:** Late assignments are generally not accepted, with a 24-hour “grace period” after the submission deadline.
- **Late Withdrawal:** The auto-W deadline is NO LONGER THE LAST DAY OF CLASS. After the auto-W deadline, withdrawal will be significantly limited, and you will need permission to withdraw and must meet requirements established by O’Neill.

## Technology and Tools
- **Technology Requirements:** You will run R and R Studio on your personal laptop computers. There will be an ungraded lab assignment at the beginning of the semester to assist with software installation.
- **Communications and Course Materials:** Canvas will be the primary platform for course material, assignments, and updates.
- **Electronic Etiquette:** Use devices responsibly during class. Misuse can distract you and others.
- **Classroom Policy on Technology:** Laptops are required for recitation. Instructors should be informed immediately if there is an alert.

## Preparation and Effort
- **Preparation for Classes:** Regularly review lecture notes, complete assigned readings, and practice problems and examples.
- **Effort and Engagement:** Embrace challenges as opportunities for growth. Seek help when needed and invest time in understanding the material deeply.
- **Collaboration and Integrity:** Collaboration is encouraged, but adherence to academic integrity principles is paramount.

## Use of Artificial Intelligence (Such as ChatGPT)
In this course, artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, can be valuable for resolving coding and syntax challenges. Coding is a tool used in statistical analysis, but understanding statistical concepts is the main objective.

### Permitted Uses:
- **Coding Assistance:** Utilizing AI, such as ChatGPT, to assist with coding, particularly with syntax issues, can be efficient. This approach is not only acceptable but also encouraged insofar as it facilitates your focus on the statistical content of the course.

### Prohibited Uses:
- **Writing Assignments:** Using AI to complete writing assignments is prohibited. If you do use AI for this purpose, you will be committing plagiarism* and will be subject to penalties in this class and sanctions by [Indiana University](https://studentcode.iu.edu/responsibilities/academic-misconduct.html).

## **Plagiarism:**
Plagiarism is defined as presenting someone else’s work, including the work of other students, as one’s own. Any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged, unless the information is common knowledge. What is considered “common knowledge” may differ from course to course.

## **IU's Grading Policies:**
