## Text
The main text for this course is an online GitBook written by the instructor that is accessible online. Additional readings, if any, will be posted on Canvas.

## Prerequisites
This course assumes you have taken at least one college-level math course prior to this; however, the course is designed to be accessible to students with math anxiety and works to be as clear as possible. Furthermore, no knowledge of R is required or expected; however, resources to improve coding in R will be provided on Canvas under the supplemental materials module and are strongly encouraged.

## Course Requirements

### Assignment Types
- **Recitation Assignments (Weekly Labs):** Weekly hands-on labs using R and RStudio to analyze environmental datasets form the basis for these assignments. They contribute 25% of your final grade. Initiated every Tuesday during recitation sessions, they must be completed individually by Sunday (at 11:59 pm) of the same week. Note that we may grade only certain sections.
- **Data Analysis Report (Project):** You will select a data set for analysis and write a 5-7 page report, comprehensible to someone with minimal statistical background. Peer-reviewed by classmates, this project aims to promote critical thinking and collaboration and accounts for 15% of your final grade.
- **Quizzes:** These low-stakes quizzes, conducted at the beginning of most classes (except for weeks with exams), will assess your understanding of the recent content and assigned readings. Comprising 10% of your final grade, their format may vary, including small-group activities. While you cannot make up missed quizzes, you may drop four of them, effectively allowing two weeks of absence without penalty.
- **Midterm Exam:** This in-class exam, covering the first half of the semester, constitutes 25% of your final grade.
- **Final Exam:** A comprehensive in-class exam, assessing knowledge and understanding of the entire course content, comprises 25% of your final grade.

### Grading Breakdown
- Recitation Assignments (Weekly Labs): 25%
- Group Data Analysis Report: 15%
- Quizzes: 10%
- Midterm Exam: 25%
- Final Exam: 25%
- Total: 100%

### Grading Scale
| Grade | Range       | Grade | Range       |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| A     | 100% to 93% | C     | < 77% to 73% |
| A-    | < 93% to 90%| C-    | < 73% to 70% |
| B+    | < 90% to 87%| D     | < 70% to 67% |
| B     | < 87% to 83%| D+    | < 67% to 63% |
| B-    | < 83% to 80%| D-    | < 63% to 60% |
| C+    | < 80% to 77%| F     | < 60% to 0%  |

Note on rounding: All final grades are rounded following standard mathematical practices (e.g., 82.5 is rounded to 83 for a B, but 82.4 is rounded to 82 for a B-). Final grades are not negotiable, and any requests for final grade changes for reasons other than calculation errors will be denied.

# Course Policies and Expectations

## Attendance
- **Consistent Attendance:** Since the topics in this course build upon previous lessons, regular attendance is crucial. Attendance is expected but not taken explicitly. Missing classes may lead to gaps in understanding that can hinder your progress in subsequent modules. Attendance is expected at all scheduled sessions, including lectures and recitation assignments.
- **Active Participation:** In addition to being present, active participation is encouraged. Engaging with the material, asking questions, participating in discussions, and working collaboratively in group activities not only enriches your learning experience but also fosters a supportive learning community.
- **Responsibility for Missed Content:** In the event that you must miss a class, it falls on you to review the content that was covered and to consult with classmates to catch up. Please refrain from sending emails inquiring simply about "what did I miss," as these messages are not conducive to meaningful engagement and will not receive a response.
- **Low-stakes quizzes:** Low-stakes quizzes will be conducted at the beginning of most classes (except weeks with exams). While missed quizzes cannot be made up, students may drop four of them, effectively allowing two weeks of absence without penalty.


## Assignment Policies
- **Makeup Exams:** Taking exams as scheduled is vital. Make-up exams must be requested one week prior to the exam date and are only for unavoidable conflicts or genuine illness. In cases of illness, inform the instructor and TAs beforehand. Abuse of this policy will not be tolerated. Should makeup exams be necessary, they will be arranged within one week of the original date, and the exam format may be altered significantly.
- **Late Assignments:** While late assignments are generally not accepted, there is a 24-hour “grace period” after the submission deadline without penalties. After this period, the assignment portal will close.
- **Late Withdrawal:** The auto-W deadline is NO LONGER THE LAST DAY OF CLASS (as it was during and immediately post-Covid).  After the auto-W deadline, withdrawal will be significantly limited, and you will need permission to withdraw and must meet requirements established by O’Neill. The Auto-W deadline for a given semester can be found [here](https://calendars.registrar.indiana.edu/official-calendar/)

## Technology and Tools
- **Technology Requirements:** You will be running R and R Studio on your personal laptop computers. Mac, Windows, and Linux computers should all be capable of running the software needed. There will be one (ungraded) lab assignment at the beginning of the semester designed to assist you with the software installation.
- **Communications and Course Materials:** Canvas will be the primary platform for disseminating course material, assignments, and updates. Please make sure to check it regularly.
- **Electronic Etiquette:** When using technology in class (including laptops, tablets, and cellphones), please ensure that it does not distract others or detract from the learning environment.
- **Familiarity with Software:** The course involves hands-on work with R and RStudio. Familiarizing yourself with these tools early in the course will support your success in lab sessions and assignments.
- **Responsible Use of Technology:** Laptops and other devices should be used responsibly during class. Misuse can distract you and others around you.
- **Classroom policy on technology:**Laptops are required for recitation You are responsible for technology use, and disruptions will not be tolerated. In line with university recommendations, I will have my phone active for campus alerts, and it is crucial that instructors are informed immediately if there is an alert.

## Preparation and Effort
- **Preparation for Classes:** Success in this course requires regular review of lecture notes, completion of assigned readings, and practice with problems and examples. Coming to class prepared will enable you to actively participate and grasp complex concepts.
- **Effort and Engagement:** Persistence and effort are key to mastering statistical concepts. Embrace challenges as opportunities for growth, seek help when needed, and invest time in understanding the material deeply.
- **Collaboration and Integrity:** While collaboration is encouraged in group activities, adherence to academic integrity principles is paramount. Ensure that all submitted work reflects your understanding and effort.

## Use of Artificial Intelligence (Such as ChatGPT)
In this course, we recognize that artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, can be a valuable resource for resolving coding and syntax challenges. The primary focus of this course is to cultivate your understanding of statistical concepts, rather than to develop expertise in coding. Although coding is a tool used in statistical analysis, it is not the main learning objective. Even seasoned coders frequently refer to online resources for assistance, and you are encouraged to do the same as needed. My role as your professor is to guide you in the realm of statistics, not to provide technical support for coding issues.

### Permitted Uses:
- **Coding Assistance:** Utilizing AI, such as ChatGPT, to assist with coding, particularly with syntax issues, can be efficient. This approach is not only acceptable but also encouraged insofar as it facilitates your focus on the statistical content of the course.

### Prohibited Uses:
- **Writing Assignments:** Using AI to complete writing assignments is prohibited. If you do use AI for this purpose, you will be committing plagiarism* and will be subject to penalties in this class and sanctions by [Indiana University](https://studentcode.iu.edu/responsibilities/academic-misconduct.html).

##*Plagiarism:*##
Plagiarism is defined as presenting someone else’s work, including the work of other students, as one’s own. Any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged, unless the information is common knowledge. What is considered “common knowledge” may differ from course to course.
